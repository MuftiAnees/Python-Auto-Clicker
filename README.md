# Auto Clicker

This is an auto clicker written in python. I use this to open up 'MySQL' on my office computer and automatically run a Query. Since I had to repeat this process daily at the start of the day (I am the first one to reach office) I got tired of the mundane task and wrote a script to automate it for me.
